  <p>Take a wild guess as to what will you say to describe a paragraph? From whatever you may know so far, many students describe paragraphs as what consists the
  story, or a set of sentences that are grouped together to form a paragraph or a set of sentences that cover half a page of your story, and so on.</p><br>
  <p>Although these ideas may look true in many instances, they donâ€™t really define what the idea behind a paragraph is. This is one of those subtle things in English writing 
  that never really gets explained on priority making it one of those commonly used things that are barely understood. Which is why this read is going to be great.</p>
